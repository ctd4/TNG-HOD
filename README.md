# TNG-HOD
Files:
HODplot.py: Program that creates HOD with error bars allowing HOD to be split into 2 populations.
HODplot3.py: Program that fuctions the same as HODplot.py but also plots the central and satellite galaxies.
grad.py: Program that downloads cutout data for subhalos to find metallicity/age gradient for each subhalo.
grad4.py: Program similar to grad.py but calculates age gradient out to 4Re with 2 bins for classifying how gradient changes.
classify.py: Program that classifys galaxies into 3 types depending on how gradient changes.
add.py: Program that adds fake data to lengthen gradient data to allow the gradient arrays to have correct indexing for TNG's central galaxy index parameter: GroupFirstSub.
